0 - main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
1 - Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2 - program prints the largest of three integers
3 - program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration
